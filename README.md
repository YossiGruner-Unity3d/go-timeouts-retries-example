# Timeout and Retry Patterns in Go

This repository contains code examples demonstrating the implementation of timeout and retry patterns in Go using various libraries. It also includes a summary of industry best practices for handling timeouts and retries in Go applications.

## Code Examples

### Using `context.WithTimeout`

This code example demonstrates the use of the `context.WithTimeout` function to set a timeout for a specific task. It ensures that the task respects the defined timeout and cancels if the timeout is exceeded.

### Using `retry-go` Library

This code example showcases the integration of the `retry-go` library to implement retry functionality with backoff. It combines retry logic with the context timeout, providing a robust approach for handling transient errors.

### Using Circuit Breaker with Retry


This code example illustrates the combination of circuit breaker, retry, and timeout patterns. It demonstrates how to protect your application from repeated failures and how to handle retries within a circuit breaker context.

## Industry Best Practices for Timeouts and Retries

### Timeouts:

1. **Set Realistic Timeouts**: Define appropriate timeout values based on the nature of the operation and expected response times. Shorten timeouts for user-facing interactions and longer timeouts for background tasks.

2. **Use a Context**: Utilize the context package to manage timeouts and cancellations. It enables consistent propagation of context and allows graceful shutdown of operations that exceed their time limit.

3. **Graceful Degradation**: Design your application to gracefully degrade functionality or provide fallback options when a timeout occurs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

4. **Avoid Blocking**: Implement asynchronous programming patterns to prevent blocking threads while waiting for a response. Use channels, goroutines, or asynchronous libraries to handle timeouts effectively.

### Retries:

1. **Exponential Backoff**: Implement an exponential backoff strategy for retries. This involves increasing the time interval between retries exponentially to reduce the load on servers and avoid overwhelming resources.

2. **Max Retries**: Define a maximum number of retries to prevent infinite retries in case of persistent failures. Balancing retries with a reasonable maximum threshold is crucial.

3. **Jitter**: Introduce randomization (jitter) to retry intervals to prevent synchronization of retry attempts and reduce potential spikes in traffic during recovery.

4. **Circuit Breaker**: Implement a circuit breaker pattern to temporarily halt retries when repeated failures occur, allowing systems to recover and preventing continuous retries during degraded states.

### Circuit Breakers:

1. **Protection from Repeated Failures**: Use a circuit breaker to prevent repeated calls to a failing service or component, reducing load and allowing systems to recover.

2. **Graceful Handling of Failures**: Circuit breakers allow you to gracefully degrade functionality during system outages, offering fallback options to maintain a smoother user experience.

3. **Monitoring and Metrics**: Implement circuit breakers with monitoring and metrics to track the health of services, enabling informed decisions about retry attempts.
